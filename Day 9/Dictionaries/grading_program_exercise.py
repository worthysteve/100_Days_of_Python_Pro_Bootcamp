# Grading Program
# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

# Write a program that converts their scores to grades.

# By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names as keys and their assessed grades for values.

# The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.

# **DO NOT** modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.

# This is the scoring criteria:
# - Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
# - Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
# - Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
# - Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
